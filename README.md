# top_users_bot

Please note, this bot is not currently finished. The instructions below will only apply when the bot is finished and ready to be used.


## About
This bot will send the moderators of a subreddit a list of the top 10 contributors each month.

## Setup

### Obtain a set of credentials

This is done to allow you to interact with the Reddit API.
You will need a Reddit account if you do not already have one.
To obtain the necessary credentials, Reddit has created a guide which you can find [here](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/OAuth2-Quick-Start-Example#first-steps_). 
The guide is a little unclear about where you can find your client IDâ€”it is the alphanumeric string you will find under the text "personal use script" after you have clicked the "create app" button. 
 
### Create a config file

You can do this with any text editor, i.e. Notepad on Windows. Open a text editor and paste the below text.

```
[config]
client_id=replace
client_secret=replace
password=replace
username=replace
user_agent=bot run by u/your_username_here
```
Replace each section where the word ```replace``` appears with your own credentials and add your username to the user agent.
Save this file as ```praw.ini``` and make sure it is saved in the same folder as this bot.

### Run the bot

Run the bot by opening the ```top_users_bot.py``` file.
Everything else will happen automatically; you just have to let the script run.
To ensure everything is working properly, you will receive a starting message to let you know the bot is running.
After that, you will receive a message on the first of each month with a list of the top 10 users of your subreddit.
